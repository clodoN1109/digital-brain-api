Node Express API server for the digital-brain-app project.

This is a server for the digital-brain-app project, that was originated from the final exercise of the course on web development from the ZTM Academy (The Complete Web Developer in 2023: Zero to Mastery ), with the objectives of learning how to build and deploy a real web application using React, Express and PostgreSQL.

I intend to expand its concept over time by incluing more AI tools and by making UI improvements.
